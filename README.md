# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Amazon Vine Analysis
The goal of the Amazon Vine Analysis was tohelp Jennifer to analyze Amazon reviews as part of the paid Amazon Vine program. This program facilitates reviews for products. Participating companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to members of the program, and those members are then required to publish a review. This analysis looked at the pet products dataset and the goal was to assess any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members (paid program) vs. non-Vine members (unpaid reviews). 

## Results

The following table provides an example of the various pet products that were included in this analysis:

**Non-Vine Program Results (unpaid reviews)**
The following output shows total reviews from Vine program members (37,790), total 5-star reviews from Vine program members (20,605), and the percentage of 5-star reviews of total reviews by Vine program members (55%).

## Summary
Interestingly, there was a higher percentage of 5-star reviews from the unpaid review category (non-vine members). I expected that there may be positivity bias in the Vine member group since they received the products for free, but the results show that the Vine members had proportionally less 5-star reviews. There are many additional analyses that could be incorporated to further understand this dataset. For example, we could look at percentage of 4 star reviews and/or percentage of 1 and 2 star reviews which expands the analysis beyond 5-stars. We could also look at which reviews are most helpful to see if the vine program reviews are having a more significant impact than the non-Vine program reviews.
